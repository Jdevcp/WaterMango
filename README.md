# WaterMango
 WaterMango challenge

I wrote the application in .NET core with a React front end, I took it upon myself to write the front end in react to learn it more as i've never worked with it before.

This however ended up biting me in the butt as I underestimated how much more time I would've needed to understand the concepts, however the app is functioning just with some slight pieces missing and some weird functionality.

The app contains a Entity Framework data model in which it'll create a local SQL database on first run, this should be all there is to running it(localhost:44393).
