 WaterMango challenge

I wrote the application in .NET core with a React front end, I took it upon myself to write the front end in react to learn it more as i've never worked with it before.

The app contains a Entity Framework data model in which it'll create a local SQL database on first run, this should be all there is to running it(localhost:44393).
